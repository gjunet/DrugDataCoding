\title{Process Drug-Related ICD-10 Codes in Death Records}
\usage{
process_death_records_extended(data, icd_vars = paste0("MCOD", 1:10))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing ICD-10 cause of death codes}

\item{icd_vars}{A character vector containing the names of variables in the data that contain ICD-10 codes.
Default is "MCOD1" through "MCOD10", which are common multiple causes of death variables in mortality data.}
}
\value{
The original data frame with additional columns for each drug-related indicator:
\itemize{
\item Broad indicators: drug_overdose_death, alcohol_attributable_death
\item Poisoning indicators by drug category: alcohol_poisoning, opioid_poisoning,
heroin_poisoning, methadone_poisoning, fentanyl_poisoning, cannabis_poisoning,
sedative_poisoning, cocaine_poisoning, stimulant_poisoning, hallucinogen_poisoning,
nicotine_poisoning, inhalant_poisoning, polydrug_poisoning, antidepressant_poisoning,
antipsychotic_poisoning
\item Summary indicator: any_drug_poisoning

\description{
This function processes death records to identify drug-related causes of death using ICD-10 codes.
It creates binary indicators for drug overdose deaths and specific drug poisonings based on
CDC definitions from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
}
\details{
This function is based on the ICD-10 coding guidelines from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
It identifies drug overdose deaths based on underlying cause codes (X40-X44, X60-X64, X85, Y10-Y14) and
specific drug poisonings based on multiple-cause-of-death codes (T-codes).

The function uses regular expressions to search for specific ICD-10 code patterns in the specified
variables. The CDC defines drug overdose deaths based on specific underlying causes of death, while
the specific drugs involved are identified using T-codes in the multiple causes of death fields.

# Using default ICD10 variable names (MCOD1:MCOD10)
processed_data <- process_death_records_extended(mortality_data)

# Using custom ICD10 variable names
custom_vars <- c("CAUSE1", "CAUSE2", "CAUSE3", "CAUSE4")
processed_data <- process_death_records_extended(mortality_data, icd_vars = custom_vars)
